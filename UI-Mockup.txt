UI Mockup for Event Scheduler
1. Dashboard (Event List)
Purpose: The dashboard displays all scheduled events in a tabular format for easy viewing and management.

Components:

Event List: A table showing all events with the following columns:

Event Name: The name of the event (e.g., "Team Meeting").

Start Date: The date when the event is scheduled to begin (e.g., "2025-04-15").

Start Time: The time when the event will start (e.g., "10:00 AM").

Duration: The duration of the event (e.g., "1 hour").

Repeat Days: Days of the week the event repeats, if applicable (e.g., "Monday, Wednesday").

Actions: Buttons for "Edit" action.

Functionality:

The table is scrollable to accommodate multiple events.

Each event is clickable, with the ability to edit it.

There’s a "Create Event" button at the top-right corner of the table to allow users to add new events.

2. Create Event Form
Purpose: This form allows users to create new events by providing necessary details.

Components:

Event Name (Text Input): A field where users input the name of the event.

Example: "Weekly Sync Meeting"

Start Date (Date Picker): A field for selecting the start date of the event.

Example: "2025-04-15"

Start Time (Time Picker): A field for selecting the start time of the event.

Example: "10:00 AM"

Duration (Text Input or Number Input): A field for specifying the duration of the event.

Example: "1 hour"

Repeat Days (Checkboxes): A set of checkboxes for users to select the days of the week on which the event should repeat. Days like "Monday", "Wednesday", etc., should be listed with checkboxes.

Example: "Monday", "Wednesday"

Submit Button: A button to submit the form and create the event.

Cancel Button: A button to close the form and discard changes.

Behavior:

When the "Create Event" button is clicked, the form should appear in a modal or as a full-page form.

The user can choose to create a one-time event or a recurring event (by selecting days in the Repeat Days section).

On successful submission, the event is added to the event list and the form is closed.

3. Event Update Form
Purpose: This form allows users to update the details of an existing event.

Components:

Event Name (Text Input): Pre-filled with the current event name, editable.

Start Date (Date Picker): Pre-filled with the current event's start date, editable.

Start Time (Time Picker): Pre-filled with the current event's start time, editable.

Duration (Text Input or Number Input): Pre-filled with the current event's duration, editable.

Repeat Days (Checkboxes): Pre-filled with the days on which the event repeats, editable. If the event doesn't repeat, no days should be selected.

Save Button: A button to save changes to the event.

Cancel Button: A button to discard changes and close the form.

Behavior:

When the "Edit" button next to an event is clicked, this form should open, with the fields pre-filled with the event’s existing details.

The user can modify the event details and submit the changes.

On successful submission, the updated event appears in the event list.

If there are any conflicts with other scheduled events (e.g., same date and time), an error message will be displayed, and the update will not occur.

4. Event Conflict Warning
Purpose: To notify users when a new event conflicts with an existing event.

Components:

Conflict Alert: A red-colored alert box that shows when an event conflict occurs.

Message: "Conflict detected! An event is already scheduled for this time."

Functionality:

If a user tries to create or update an event that conflicts with an existing one (same start time and date), the conflict alert will be displayed.

The form will not allow the user to submit the event until the conflict is resolved.


5. Responsive Design
Purpose: The UI should be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes and devices.

Behavior:

On smaller screens (e.g., mobile devices), the event list may be presented as a scrolling list with the event details shown in a card-style layout.

The "Create Event" button should be accessible on all screen sizes, possibly changing position or appearance on mobile.

The form inputs should be easy to interact with on smaller screens (e.g., date and time pickers optimized for mobile).

6. General Styling and Themes
Color Scheme: A simple and professional color scheme, using colors like blue for buttons and headers, with red for error messages and warnings.

Typography: Clear and readable fonts, with larger fonts for headers and smaller, more concise text for event details.

Button Design: Buttons should be distinct, with rounded corners and hover/active states.
